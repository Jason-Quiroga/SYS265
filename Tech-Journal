DOCKER - PROJECT WIKI

I. Installing Rocket.Chat
  A. Installation:
    1. Website that I used to help me download it: https://docs.rocket.chat/installation/docker-containers/docker-compose
    2. Log on to docker01 (through an SSH so you can copy paste; use mgmt01)
    3. Go to the home directory if you're not already there
    4. Create a new directory called whatever you want (mkdir ./rocketchat). This is where we will store the YAML file that we need to run
    5. Enter the directory (cd ./rocketchat)
    6. When inside the directory, pull the .YAML file from the github page to add to your directory using the command:
      a. curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/develop/docker-compose.yml -o stack.yaml
      b. This will pull the file from the provided link and output it into the new file called "stack.yaml".
    7. Open the file using your prefered text editor (mine is vi)
    8. Look and make sure the ROOT_URL matches your URL (or localhost), as well as making sure that "image:" is set to "rocketchat/rocket.chat:latest".
    9. Save and close the file after making the necessary edits.
    10. Allow port 3000 through the firewall (sudo ufw allow 3000/tcp)
    11. You can now start the stack with "docker-compose -f -d stack.yaml up". The -d will make it run detatched, allowing you to use docker01 freely while this runs.
    12. Allow a few minutes for the program to download, extract, and start everything.
    13. Log onto the website on a system in your domain (I used mgmt01) by using the address: "http://docker01-jason:3000".
    14. This will bring you to the setup page for Rocket.Chat.
    15. Fill in the necessary information to create an admin account and server information.
    16. Once finished, it should bring you to a login page where you can use your username (my email is what worked for me) and password to log on to the service.
    17. Once in, you can navigate to the chat and type freely to your peers!
    18. To stop the service, you can use the command "docker-compose stop stack.yaml" (If stack.yaml doesn't work, try "rocketchat" instead).

I. Ubuntu
  A. How to set a static IP address on an Ubuntu Server
    1. Figure out the name of the interface that you want to configure. Use the command "ip link" to see the interfaces (mine was ens160)
    2. Navigate to your /etc/netplan directory, and you'll see a file called "00-installer-config.yaml". Sudo vi into this "sudo vi ./00-installer-config.yaml"
      a. If you don't sudo vi it, you won't be able to save any changes you make since it's a read only file.
    3. Change the file to look like this:
     network:
       ethernets:
         ens160: //This is the name of whatever the interface you have
           dhcp: no
           addresses:
                   - 10.0.5.12/24
           gateway4: 10.0.5.2
           nameservers:
                   addresses: [10.0.5.5]
       version: 2
       renderer: networkd
      
      4. Save the file
      5. Then, type "sudo netplan apply". If you have any errors, the program will tell you where they are.
      6. Check that your changes are active by typing "ip addr" and see if your ens160 has changed IP addresses. You should now be able to ping inside and outside the network
      7. Link to guide: https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-configure-static-ip-address-on-ubuntu-20-04/
    B. Changing the hostname on Ubuntu
      1. To view the current hostname, type "hostnamectl"
      2. To change, type "hostnamectl set-hostname [name]", in my case the name is "docker01-jason"
      3. Verify that the name changed by reusing the "hostnamectl" command.
      4. You will also want to sudo vi into "/etc/hosts" and change the second host (presumably "ubuntu") to your new host name and save.
      5. Also, sudo vi into "/etc/cloud/cloud.cfg" and search for "preserve_hostname" and set that to true.
        a. The cloud also automatically disables root SSH, which is a nice feature for us.
      6. Source: https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-change-hostname-on-ubuntu-18-04/
    C. Make sure to add PTR and AAA records to the AD.
    D. Adding a sudo user to Ubuntu
      1. In ubuntu and in root, use the command "sudo adduser jason"
      2. Fill in the necessary information
      4. To make the user a sudo user, use the command "usermod -aG sudo jason"
    E. Installing Docker
      1. Refer to this guide: https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-and-use-docker-on-ubuntu-20-04
    F. Installing Docker-Compose
      1. Refer to this guide: https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-and-use-docker-compose-on-ubuntu-20-04
    G. Command syntax
      1. "-p" is used to publish a specific port on the container to a specific port on the host system
        a. Ex: "docker run -p 10.0.5.12:80:8080/tcp ubuntu bash"
        b. This command will bind the container's port "8080" to tcp port 80 on 10.0.5.12 on the host's machine.
        c. Note that ports which are not bound to the host (i.e., -p 80:80 instead of -p 127.0.0.1:80:80) will be accessible from the outside.
      2. "docker images" is used to see what images you have installed.
      3. "docker ps" Is used to list images and see status, uptime, commands, and what ports it's connected to
      4. The following command will pull down the image, application and dependencies associated with a simple python web application: 
         "docker run -d -P training/webapp python app.py"
         a. You can see what port this is running on by typing "docker ps", and it will say "training/webapp" and under the ports section, it will say "0.0.0.0:(PORT)"
         b. The "0.0.0.0" means that any ip trying to access it through the respective port will be able to access it. They would connect by using the host ip and this port
            (after allowing the port through the firewall, of course).
    H. Ubuntu Firewall
      1. To enable a port to run through firewall, use the command "sudo ufw allow from any to any port (PORT) proto tcp"
      2. Turn the firewall on with "sudo ufw enable" (or, if it's up, use "sudo ufw reload") I DON'T THINK YOU NEED TO RELOAD IT
      3. Check to see if your port is allowed through with "sudo ufw status"
      4. ALSO: to enable ssh through the firewall, you type "sudo ufw allow ssh".
        a. IF YOU WANT SSH TO ACTUALLY WORK, USE PUTTY. NORMAL SSH SEEMS TO NOT WORK VERY WELL.
    I. When you're trying to connect to a webserver container, use the syntax "http://docker01-jason:49153" where 49153 is the port
      1. You may have to restart the container if it does not work at first (or just start in in general) with "docker start (NAME)" where name is whatever comes after the
         port number of your container when you type "docker ps" (mine was "admiring_proskuriakova").
      2. Similarly, to stop, you can use the command "docker stop (NAME)".

  A. How to create a VM in EC2
    1. Select AWS console to get to the console
    2. Click "Launch a Virtual Machine"
    3. Pick the "Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 (HVM)" because IT IS FREE, LOOK FOR FREE ONES
    4. Select 64 bit x86
    5. Make sure the type is T2 micro (because it's free)
    6. Click configure details
    7. You can stick with all of the defaults on the next page
    8. Click add storage in the bottom right, but you don't need to add any storage
    9. Click "Review and Launch"
    10. Click Launch
    11. You will be prompted to either choose an existing key pair or make a new one
    12. Create a new key pair called "SYS265-SP21" and make sure you download it as well and put it somewhere safe that you will remember.
    13. Launch the instance (it will take a bit).
    14. You can look up "Instances" in the box, and you can see that your box is running and you can see information about it (IP Address)
    15. Now you can load a CMD to connect to your box via SSH
    16. On the command prompt IN YOUR UBUNTU BOX, change the permissions of your key using the command "chmod 40 Desktop/SYS265-SP21.pem" (ubuntu on my personal desktop, jason
        Username and normal password)
    17. Use the command "ssh ec2-user@[ipaddress] -i [path to key]", in my case "ssh ec2-user@54.197.44.246 -i Desktop/SYS265-SP21.pem"
      a. ssh'ing with the ec2-user at the certain IP and using the input file SYS265-SP21.pem
    18. Now you should be in the system.
  B. How to update the EC2 instance
    1. Type in "sudo yum -y update" and it will update.
  C. How to install python3
    1. "sudo yum install -y python3.8
    2. Use "python3.8" instead of "python3" when inputting commands
  D. How to start a python http server
    1. Create a new directory using the command "mkdir test-firewall"
    2. Enter the directory with "cd test-firewall"
    3. Use the command "echo "Testing EC2 Firewall" > index.html
    4. Start the http server using "python3.8 -m http.server 9000"
    5. In the AWS website, go into the EC2 instance and go to the "Security" tab and open up the security groups
    6. Edit the inbound rules and add a new rule with port 9000 with source "0.0.0.0/0" (meaning all ips) with description "testing firewall" and save rules.
  E. Create a Windows Server "Microsoft Windows Server 2019" (it should be free) and configure it similarly to above, however when you get to step 6 (security groups),
     select use an existing and pick launch-wizard 1.
    1. Add an inbound rule with type "RDP" and the port should switch to 3389, also add everyone as a source and give it the description "RDP Inbound".
    2. To get into the box, you need to know the administrator password. To do this, you will need access to the key file.
    3. On the AWS menu in "Instances", select the windows box and in the top right select where it says "Actions" and select "Security", then "Get windows password".
    4. Select the key pair and then hit decrypt password. Write down this password somewhere.
    5. You now have the password, so you can connect using RDP (mstsc on windows REMOTE DESKTOP).
      a. You can find the IP address to connect on the Window's Server's Instance. Then, when asked for a username and password, select more options and put in "Administrator"
        and the password that you wrote down.
