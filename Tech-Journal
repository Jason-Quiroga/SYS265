I. How to setup DHCP on PFSense
  A. Instructions
    1. Log on to WKS01
    2. Open chrome and enter the IP of the firewall (in my case, it's 10.0.5.2)
    3. Log in (for pfsense it was "admin" and "pfsense")
    4. When on PFSense, on the top bar navigate to Services->DHCP Server, then click on LAN when you get to the page
    5. Choose to enable DHCP on the LAN interface
    6. In Range, insert the range that you want the server to run on
    7. Choose Change DHCP display lease time from UTC to local time
    8. Under DNS servers, input the DNS server (10.0.5.5)
    9. Under Gateway, input the gateway (10.0.5.2, the address of the firewall)
    10. Under Domain name, insert the name of the domain (in my case, JASON)
    11. Click the "Save" button at the bottom of the page
    12. Your DNS server should now work. Change your WKS's IP settings to get automatically from DHCP server instead of static, then ipconfig /all to confirm.
