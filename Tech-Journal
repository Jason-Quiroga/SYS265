CentOS 8

I. CentOS8
  A. To connect to ansible2 (Our CentOS 8 server)
    1. From mgmt01: "ssh deployer@ansible2-jason.jason.local", then enter password
  B. Nmcli
    1. Command: "nmcli"
    2. Used to controll NetworkManager
    3. When used on it's own (just nmcli), shows network info
  C. Changing IP address using nmcli
    1. Use the command "sudo nmcli connection modify ens192 IPv4.address 10.0.5.234"
    2. Then "nmcli connection down ens192 && sudo nmcli connection up ens192"
      a. This will disrupt SSH, so make sure you change the DNS record for it and then try SSHing again.
  D. Cockpit
    1. Linux server management via web interface
  E. Installing Cockpit
    1. "dnf install cockpit -y"
    2. "systemctl start cockpit.socket" and "systemctl enable cockpit.socket" to enable at boot.
    3. "firewall-cmd --permanent --add-service=cockpit" and then reload with "firewall-cmd --reload"
    4. Now, connect to the website on the internet using port 9090
    5. Login using your useraccount
  F. How to add Ansible2 to your AD Domain
    1. "dnf install realmd sssd oddjob oddjob-mkhomedir adcli samba-common samba-common-tools krb5-workstation authselect-compat"
    2. To join the domain, use "realm join jason.local -U jason.quiroga-adm" then enter the password
      a. You need to make sure you have a domain admin account created. Do this by going into the AD DS on mgmt01 and right clicking and going to AD Users and Computers
         and adding a new account in the Domain Administrators role.
    3. To verify that it worked, type "realm list" and it should list jason.local
    4. Then, "authselect select sssd" and "authselect select sssd with-mkhomedir
    5. Restart the service: "systemctl restart sssd"
    6. The command "id deployer" should now work and give you the groups that the user "deployer" is now in, or "id jason.quiroga-adm@jason.local"
    7. Now, to add a domain user to be able to ssh into the ansible 2 box, type "realm permit jason.quiroga-adm@jason.local".
    8. To allow a user access to sudo perms, create the sudo config file: "vi /etc/sudoers.d/domain_admins".
    9. While editing the file, to add a single user use "jason.quiroga-adm@jason.local  ALL=(ALL) ALL" then save.
      a. To add all domain admins, use "&Domain_Admins@jason.local  ALL=(ALL) ALL".
    10. You should now be able to login to ansible2 using jason.quiroga-adm@jason.local.
  G. To add Ansible1 to be monitored by Ansible2
    1. On ansible2, install "cockpit_dashboard" with "dnf install cockpit-dashboard -y", then reload cockpit with "systemctl restart cockpit.socket"
    2. Now, on ansible2's cockpit, you will see the dashboard tab. Click on the dashboard.
    3. In the dashboard, click the plus on the right and fill in the information for Ansible1 (deployer user, IP of 10.0.5.91, etc.)
    4. You should now see Ansible1 being monitored. If you click in the Host tab, you can now select between ansbile1 and ansible2.

Ansible & Controller

I. Controller Setup
  A. Controller is an Ubuntu server, so use the notes below on Ubuntu to help set up your server.
    1. To make the nameserver actually run, I had to sudo vi into "/etc/resolv.conf" and change where it says "nameserver" to "10.0.5.5".
II. Ansible
  A. How to install
    1. On Controller, use the command "sudo apt install ansible sshpass python3-paramiko"
    2. On all linux systems (controller, ansible 1 and 2), use this command to create a file "vi /etc/sudoers.d/sys265", and add the following:
      a. "deployer      ALL=(ALL)     NOPASSWD: ALL
  B. Requiring no password to log in to a user on a different system, instead using keys
    0. Set the time that your keys will last for with the command "ssh-add -t 14400"
    1. Start by creating a new private and public key on your controller "ssh-keygen -t rsa -C "sys265""
    2. Set to the default location, and enter the passphrase twice (I did "passphrase").
    3. Now, use this command to send your public key to the specified server "ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub deployer@ansible1-jason.jason.local",
       replacing "deployer" with the user you want to be allowed to SSH and "ansible1-jason.jason.local" with the hostname.
    4. Enter the user's password that you are trying to allow
    5. You should now be able to SSH into that system and that user by just using the passphrase you created.
  C. Getting started
    1. Return to your home directory and create two new directories using this command: "mkdir -p ansible/roles"
    2. cd into ansible
    3. Create a new document called "inventory.txt" and inside of it add the hostnames (ansible1-jason.jason.local and the other one), each on separate lines and save.
    4. Now, you can use ansible to run commands from the hosts in your inventory.txt file.
  D. Commands
    1. "ansible all -m ping -i inventory.txt" --> Runs a ping command on all hosts in the inventory.txt file, responding with PONG.
    2. "ansible all -a [COMMAND] -i inventory.txt" --> Runs the specified command on all hosts in the inventory.txt file, returning the command output
    3. "ansible [GROUPNAME] [COMMAND] -i inventory.txt" --> Runs the specified command on only the hosts in the defined group.
      a. To define this group, simply add "[GROUPNAME]" above the hosts that you want in the group. For example, I have "ansible2-jason.jason.local" in the group "[webmin]"
  E. Ansible Galaxy and Semuadmin
    1. Similar to dockerhub, contains a rich set of ansible scripts.
    2. We installed semuadmin.webmin, a server administration tool, with "ansible-galaxy install semuadmin.webmin -p roles/". The semuadmin directory is now in
       the roles directory.
    3. We're now going to create a rulebook called "webmin.yml" to create a simple script. DON'T USE TABS, USE TWO SPACES.
    4. Execute the playbook with "ansible-playbook -i inventory.txt roles/webmin.yml" and wait for it to finish, it will take a bit
    5. It says that it opens port 10000, but I found I had to do it myself on ansible2-jason.
    6. After opening the port, navigate to "https://ansible2-jason.jason.local:10000"
    7. Enter the root username and password
    8. You should now be in the interface viewing anbsible2's information

Git & Linux SSH Script
I. Git installation
  A. Command
    1. On docker01, it's "sudo apt install git", but it should already be installed
    2. On Web01, it's "sudo yum install git -y"
II. Git Commands
  A. Basic Commands
    1/2. THE MOST BASIC COMMANDS ARE ADD, COMMIT, AND PUSH ("git add .", "git commit -m "words"", "git push")
    1. "git clone [URL]" --> Pulls the repository from the following link USES THE URL OF THE REPO
    2. "git add ." to add all files in the current directory to your queue to commit
    3. "git status" tells you what branch you're on and if you're up to date and what changes you currently have to commit
    4. "git config user.email [EMAIL]" --> Sets the email of the person currently editing the repo (You need to do this before committing so that git knows which user is 
        trying to commit).
    5. "git config user.name [NAME]" --> Sets the name of the user currently editing the repo (see above)
    6. "git commit -m "[REASON]" " --> Commits to merge with the most recent branch.
    7. "git push" --> Pushes the most recent commit upstream to git (will have to input username and password)
    8. "git checkout ." --> Restores files in the current directory that were deleted before the next commit.
    9. *** With the echo command, you can use $(COMMANDHERE) to have the echo command output a command. For example, "echo $(hostname)" will return the hostname.
    10. "git pull" --> Pulls the most recent changes from the current repository. Syncs your machine back up with git. YOU MUST BE IN THE DIRECTORY
    
III. How to create a keypair in Centos7
  A. How to
    1. Enter the "public-keys" directory that you created earlier
    2. Use the command "ssh-keygen -t rsa -C "sys265""
    3. When asked which file to put it in, leave it blank and it will default to "/home/jason/.ssh/id_rsa"
    4. Leave the passphrase blank
    5. Now, copy that file from the directory and put it into the "public-keys" directory that you are in by using "cp ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub ." TO TAKE THE PUBLIC KEY,
       NEVER PUT YOUR PRIVATE KEY ON THE REPO EVER.
    6. "git add ."
    7. "git commit -m "adding public key"
    8. "git push"
IV. Scripting
  A. Scripting Tips
    1. To use parameters (something someone inputs in while running the command), you can use it as a variable inside of the code with "$(occurance)".
      a. The first occurance (for example, the "jason" in "bash secure-ssh.sh jason") would be $1.

DOCKER - PROJECT WIKI

I. Installing Rocket.Chat
  A. Installation:
    1. Website that I used to help me download it: https://docs.rocket.chat/installation/docker-containers/docker-compose
      a. LINK TO MY CONFIGURATION FILE THAT I USED: https://github.com/Jason-Quiroga/SYS265/blob/main/Docker-Project%20Rocket.Chat
    2. Log on to docker01 (through an SSH so you can copy paste; use mgmt01)
    3. Go to the home directory if you're not already there
    4. Create a new directory called whatever you want (mkdir ./rocketchat). This is where we will store the YAML file that we need to run
    5. Enter the directory (cd ./rocketchat)
    6. When inside the directory, pull the .YAML file from the github page to add to your directory using the command:
      a. curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/develop/docker-compose.yml -o stack.yaml
      b. This will pull the file from the provided link and output it into the new file called "stack.yaml".
    7. Open the file using your prefered text editor (mine is vi)
    8. Look and make sure the ROOT_URL matches your URL (or localhost), as well as making sure that "image:" is set to "rocketchat/rocket.chat:latest".
    9. Save and close the file after making the necessary edits.
    10. Allow port 3000 through the firewall (sudo ufw allow 3000/tcp)
    11. You can now start the stack with "docker-compose -f -d stack.yaml up". The -d will make it run detatched, allowing you to use docker01 freely while this runs.
    12. Allow a few minutes for the program to download, extract, and start everything.
    13. Log onto the website on a system in your domain (I used mgmt01) by using the address: "http://docker01-jason:3000".
    14. This will bring you to the setup page for Rocket.Chat.
    15. Fill in the necessary information to create an admin account and server information.
    16. Once finished, it should bring you to a login page where you can use your username (my email is what worked for me) and password to log on to the service.
    17. Once in, you can navigate to the chat and type freely to your peers!
    18. To stop the service, you can use the command "docker-compose stop stack.yaml" (If stack.yaml doesn't work, try "rocketchat" instead).

I. Ubuntu
  A. How to set a static IP address on an Ubuntu Server
    1. Figure out the name of the interface that you want to configure. Use the command "ip link" to see the interfaces (mine was ens160)
    2. Navigate to your /etc/netplan directory, and you'll see a file called "00-installer-config.yaml". Sudo vi into this "sudo vi ./00-installer-config.yaml"
      a. If you don't sudo vi it, you won't be able to save any changes you make since it's a read only file.
    3. Change the file to look like this:
     network:
       ethernets:
         ens160: //This is the name of whatever the interface you have
           dhcp: no
           addresses:
                   - 10.0.5.12/24
           gateway4: 10.0.5.2
           nameservers:
                   addresses: [10.0.5.5]
       version: 2
       renderer: networkd
      
      4. Save the file
      5. Then, type "sudo netplan apply". If you have any errors, the program will tell you where they are.
      6. Check that your changes are active by typing "ip addr" and see if your ens160 has changed IP addresses. You should now be able to ping inside and outside the network
      7. Link to guide: https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-configure-static-ip-address-on-ubuntu-20-04/
    B. Changing the hostname on Ubuntu
      1. To view the current hostname, type "hostnamectl"
      2. To change, type "hostnamectl set-hostname [name]", in my case the name is "docker01-jason"
      3. Verify that the name changed by reusing the "hostnamectl" command.
      4. You will also want to sudo vi into "/etc/hosts" and change the second host (presumably "ubuntu") to your new host name and save.
      5. Also, sudo vi into "/etc/cloud/cloud.cfg" and search for "preserve_hostname" and set that to true.
        a. The cloud also automatically disables root SSH, which is a nice feature for us.
      6. Source: https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-change-hostname-on-ubuntu-18-04/
    C. Make sure to add PTR and AAA records to the AD.
    D. Adding a sudo user to Ubuntu
      1. In ubuntu and in root, use the command "sudo adduser jason"
      2. Fill in the necessary information
      4. To make the user a sudo user, use the command "usermod -aG sudo jason"
    E. Installing Docker
      1. Refer to this guide: https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-and-use-docker-on-ubuntu-20-04
    F. Installing Docker-Compose
      1. Refer to this guide: https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-and-use-docker-compose-on-ubuntu-20-04
    G. Command syntax
      1. "-p" is used to publish a specific port on the container to a specific port on the host system
        a. Ex: "docker run -p 10.0.5.12:80:8080/tcp ubuntu bash"
        b. This command will bind the container's port "8080" to tcp port 80 on 10.0.5.12 on the host's machine.
        c. Note that ports which are not bound to the host (i.e., -p 80:80 instead of -p 127.0.0.1:80:80) will be accessible from the outside.
      2. "docker images" is used to see what images you have installed.
      3. "docker ps" Is used to list images and see status, uptime, commands, and what ports it's connected to
      4. The following command will pull down the image, application and dependencies associated with a simple python web application: 
         "docker run -d -P training/webapp python app.py"
         a. You can see what port this is running on by typing "docker ps", and it will say "training/webapp" and under the ports section, it will say "0.0.0.0:(PORT)"
         b. The "0.0.0.0" means that any ip trying to access it through the respective port will be able to access it. They would connect by using the host ip and this port
            (after allowing the port through the firewall, of course).
    H. Ubuntu Firewall
      1. To enable a port to run through firewall, use the command "sudo ufw allow from any to any port (PORT) proto tcp"
      2. Turn the firewall on with "sudo ufw enable" (or, if it's up, use "sudo ufw reload") I DON'T THINK YOU NEED TO RELOAD IT
      3. Check to see if your port is allowed through with "sudo ufw status"
      4. ALSO: to enable ssh through the firewall, you type "sudo ufw allow ssh".
        a. IF YOU WANT SSH TO ACTUALLY WORK, USE PUTTY. NORMAL SSH SEEMS TO NOT WORK VERY WELL.
    I. When you're trying to connect to a webserver container, use the syntax "http://docker01-jason:49153" where 49153 is the port
      1. You may have to restart the container if it does not work at first (or just start in in general) with "docker start (NAME)" where name is whatever comes after the
         port number of your container when you type "docker ps" (mine was "admiring_proskuriakova").
      2. Similarly, to stop, you can use the command "docker stop (NAME)".

  A. How to create a VM in EC2
    1. Select AWS console to get to the console
    2. Click "Launch a Virtual Machine"
    3. Pick the "Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 (HVM)" because IT IS FREE, LOOK FOR FREE ONES
    4. Select 64 bit x86
    5. Make sure the type is T2 micro (because it's free)
    6. Click configure details
    7. You can stick with all of the defaults on the next page
    8. Click add storage in the bottom right, but you don't need to add any storage
    9. Click "Review and Launch"
    10. Click Launch
    11. You will be prompted to either choose an existing key pair or make a new one
    12. Create a new key pair called "SYS265-SP21" and make sure you download it as well and put it somewhere safe that you will remember.
    13. Launch the instance (it will take a bit).
    14. You can look up "Instances" in the box, and you can see that your box is running and you can see information about it (IP Address)
    15. Now you can load a CMD to connect to your box via SSH
    16. On the command prompt IN YOUR UBUNTU BOX, change the permissions of your key using the command "chmod 40 Desktop/SYS265-SP21.pem" (ubuntu on my personal desktop, jason
        Username and normal password)
    17. Use the command "ssh ec2-user@[ipaddress] -i [path to key]", in my case "ssh ec2-user@54.197.44.246 -i Desktop/SYS265-SP21.pem"
      a. ssh'ing with the ec2-user at the certain IP and using the input file SYS265-SP21.pem
    18. Now you should be in the system.
  B. How to update the EC2 instance
    1. Type in "sudo yum -y update" and it will update.
  C. How to install python3
    1. "sudo yum install -y python3.8
    2. Use "python3.8" instead of "python3" when inputting commands
  D. How to start a python http server
    1. Create a new directory using the command "mkdir test-firewall"
    2. Enter the directory with "cd test-firewall"
    3. Use the command "echo "Testing EC2 Firewall" > index.html
    4. Start the http server using "python3.8 -m http.server 9000"
    5. In the AWS website, go into the EC2 instance and go to the "Security" tab and open up the security groups
    6. Edit the inbound rules and add a new rule with port 9000 with source "0.0.0.0/0" (meaning all ips) with description "testing firewall" and save rules.
  E. Create a Windows Server "Microsoft Windows Server 2019" (it should be free) and configure it similarly to above, however when you get to step 6 (security groups),
     select use an existing and pick launch-wizard 1.
    1. Add an inbound rule with type "RDP" and the port should switch to 3389, also add everyone as a source and give it the description "RDP Inbound".
    2. To get into the box, you need to know the administrator password. To do this, you will need access to the key file.
    3. On the AWS menu in "Instances", select the windows box and in the top right select where it says "Actions" and select "Security", then "Get windows password".
    4. Select the key pair and then hit decrypt password. Write down this password somewhere.
    5. You now have the password, so you can connect using RDP (mstsc on windows REMOTE DESKTOP).
      a. You can find the IP address to connect on the Window's Server's Instance. Then, when asked for a username and password, select more options and put in "Administrator"
        and the password that you wrote down.
